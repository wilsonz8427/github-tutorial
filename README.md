# GitHub Tutorial

_by Wilson Zhang_  

##### Note: This tutorial is mainly for people who uses Cloud 9 IDE

## Git vs. GitHub
**Git:** a version control that help keep "snapshots" of code
* The tool that you could use
* ***We do not need Github for Git to work***  

**GitHub:** stores your code in a cloud (a network of servers that is hosted on the internet)
* the service for project that uses Git
* ***We need Git to use Github***

Git is only a tool for the users to use when programming while github is a cloud that allows the users to store their code.

## Repository Setup
#### On the Cloud 9
**Please refer to *Workflow & Commands* if you need the definitions and usage of a command**  

When you first create a directory there are important steps to take before you can save your code:  
1. You should always cd (move) into the directory
2. Use `git init` to allow git to start saving your changes
3. After you have made some changes to a file you can do `git add`
4. Finally, right after `git add` you can do `git commit -m ""` to save you changes

#### New Repository on Github
When you are sign in you should see your profile picture on the top right
1. Click the profile picture and click "your repository"
2. Next click the Green Button on the right side that says "NEW" 
3. Type in a name for your repository. Name your repository the same as you have name your directory in your IDE(or local)
4. You may leave the other settings alone. If you wish, you may change it

## Workflow & Commands
#### Important Commands
`git status`
* The best tool to solve any (*most*) problems since it provide hints to fix a problem
* It is used to see the state of your file(s)  

`git init`
* To **initilize** the directory and set up the tool for git

`git add`
* It is a command to add a file to the "staging area" which lets the computer know your change
* Gets the files ready for a commit(save)

`git commit -m ""`
* A command to save your changes 
* `-m ""` allows you to add your own message to your commit(save) you put your message in between ""
* *It needs your file to be add to the "staging area"*

`git push -u origin master`
* `git push` - is to send your commits to github
* `-u` - means upstream, it saves which github repository it is sending to so next time you are pushing your saves you can just write `git push` and do not need the rest
    * *without it you have to type the whole `git push -u origin master` again*
* `origin` - the remote that we are pushing to
* `master` - the "main" branch that we are pushing to

## Rolling Back Changes
* You can use `git status` to see what you can do to undo something you have done(only works for edits and add)

#### Undo Edits
The command to use: `git checkout -- <filename>`
* This is to discard changes in the file that you have not commited yet. 

#### Undo Add
The command to use: `git reset HEAD <filename>`
* This unstages the file change and is ready for any changes that are going to be made(After you are done do `git add` again so you can save your changes)

#### Undo Commits
There are three ways: 
* `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
* `git reset HEAD~1`
* `git reset --soft HEAD~1`

`git reset --hard HEAD~1`
* To completely delete the commit and never see it again which can be dangerous
* If you have done this and want it back, there is a way to save your file
    * do git reflog to see a list of commit SHAs
    * `git checkout -b newBranchName shaCommitYouDestroyed`
    * Commits would usually stay for 90 days so you can save your commits that you don't meant to completely destroy

`git reset HEAD~1`
* To undo the current commit and undo the add
* This allows you to go back to the previous commit but keeps your changes
* You have to do `git add` and `git commit` again

`git rest --soft HEAD~1`
* To only undo the current commit
* This allows you to go back to where you just did the most recent `git add`
* You can do `git commit` and you will be jsut doing the same commit that you just had
 
#### Undo Push
The command to use: `git reset --hard <SHA code>`
* This completely changes the commit history and delete the commit even from the remote
* This is not recommend, especially when you are collaborating with others
